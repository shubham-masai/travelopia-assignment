## Coding Overview

1. Semantic HTML elements are used to define the header, footer, and main area, ensuring compatibility with HTML5 standards and accessibility to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
2. Flexbox is employed to style the header and footer, creating horizontal layouts and centering the content within them.
3. The main area, represented by a section tag, contains the hero section of the page, comprising the image, overlay, title, and button. The section is given a position of "relative", while its children are positioned absolutely. Proper positioning values are applied to center the title and button within the hero section.
4. The image is rendered using the "img" tag rather than using CSS for better accessibility and compatibility.
5. To optimize the image for different screen sizes, CSS properties such as "display: block" and "max-width: 100%" are used, while the height is left as the default value of "auto".
6. The overlay effect is achieved using the pseudo-element ::after with opacity applied to the image.
7. The button triggers an alert with the message "Hello, World!" upon clicking, utilizing the "alert()" method in JavaScript.
